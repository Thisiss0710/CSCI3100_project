CSCI3100 Project - StockStalker

This project aims to create a platform that provides information on Hong Kong and US stock markets for people with interest in finance. The core features of the application include providing quantitative predictions on stock price returns and risks, and a comment section for users to share their qualitative and quantitative views on historical and predicted stock price movements for each stock. 

Our group is going to use HTML5, CSS3 and React for front-end development. For back-end development, Node.js, Express, Python and R will be used to implement the functions of the system. MongoDB will be used to store data. The expected period of development is about 2 months, with 4 members as a team. 

One should note that information provided in this software is not investment advice and should not be treated as such. People seeking investment advice should consult investment professionals.
